## About

Carbon is a Discord bot for the Alka Hangout [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/9h8QHAj2a5) focused on moderation and security. The bot is currently in development and not actively in use on the server yet. This bot is not intended for public use, so you will need to configure it according to your specific needs.
